## ÔøΩÔ∏è Frontend Application (React)

This project is a modern business loan application frontend built with React.js. It features a professional UI, robust authentication, onboarding flow, and is ready for deployment on Netlify.

### Features

- **Onboarding Flow:** Users are guided through profile creation, business details, and then to the dashboard.
- **Dashboard:** Displays user, business, and loan status information.
- **Conditional Navigation:** Redirects users based on profile/business completion.
- **Logout:** Secure logout, only shown on protected pages.
- **Responsive UI:** Professionally styled with CSS.
- **Netlify Ready:** SPA routing and environment variable support.

### Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies:**
	```bash
	npm install
	```
2. **Set up environment variables:**
	- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
	- Add your backend API URL:
	  ```env
	  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com/api
	  ```
3. **Run the development server:**
	```bash
	npm start
	```
	The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Deployment (Netlify)
1. **Build the app:**
	```bash
	npm run build
	```
2. **Ensure the following files are present:**

	- `.env` (with your API URL)
	- `.gitignore` (ignores sensitive files)
3. **Deploy to Netlify:**
	- Drag and drop the `build` folder in Netlify UI, or connect your repo.
	- Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard as needed.
